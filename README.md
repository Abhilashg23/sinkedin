# 🌊 SinkedIn

A platform where people share their career missteps, mistakes, and the lessons they’ve learned — because real stories of failure are often more powerful than polished success stories.

## 🚀 About the Project

SinkedIn was born from the idea that failure isn’t the opposite of success — it’s a vital part of it. Unlike traditional platforms that highlight only achievements, SinkedIn encourages users to embrace vulnerability and reflect on their professional low points so others can learn and grow.

Whether it's a job interview gone wrong or a startup that didn't take off, this space gives a voice to the stories no one usually talks about.
